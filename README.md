# PNG to C++ Byte Array Generator

This tool converts PNG images into C++ byte arrays, which can be embedded directly into your C++ projects. The generated code is formatted with 10 hexadecimal values per line, and saved in a `.txt` file for easy inclusion in your code.

## Features

* Converts PNG images into byte arrays in C++ format.
* The byte array is formatted in lines of 10 hexadecimal values per line.
* Automatically calculates the total number of bytes and generates the declaration for `_Image[]` with the correct size.
* Saves the generated code into a `.txt` file for easy copying and pasting.

## Requirements

* **Python 3.9** (recommended version)

You can download Python 3.9 from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-390/).

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/png-to-cpp-byte-array.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd png-to-cpp-byte-array
   ```

3. It is recommended to create a virtual environment to isolate dependencies:

   ```bash
   python3.9 -m venv venv
   ```

4. Activate the virtual environment:

   * On **Windows**:

     ```bash
     .\venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   * On **macOS/Linux**:

     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

5. Install the required Python libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### Step 1: Prepare the PNG image

Make sure your PNG image is ready for conversion. The program works with **non-compressed PNG files**.

### Step 2: Run the Script

1. Place your PNG image file in the same directory as the script or provide the path to the image.

2. Run the script by executing the following command:

   ```bash
   python convert_logo image.png
   ```

   Change the name of your image to image

### Step 3: Check the Output

The program will generate a `.txt` file with the C++ code for the byte array. It will look something like this:

```cpp
inline unsigned char Image[19477] = {
    0x89, 0x50, 0x4E, 0x47, 0x0D, 0x0A, 0x1A, 0x0A, 0x00, 0x00,
    0x00, 0x0D, 0x49, 0x48, 0x44, 0x52, 0x00, 0x00, 0x01, 0x10,
    0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x99, 0x08, 0x06, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0xE7,
    ...
};
```

You can then copy this code directly into your C++ project.

## Python Dependencies

* **Pillow** (for working with PNG images)

To install it, run:

```bash
pip install pillow
```

## Troubleshooting

* **Error: "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'Pillow'"**

  If you encounter this error, make sure you have installed the dependencies by running:

  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

* **Error: "ValueError: Incorrect number of bytes"**

  This error usually happens if the PNG file is corrupted or not in a standard format. Please ensure the image is a valid PNG.
